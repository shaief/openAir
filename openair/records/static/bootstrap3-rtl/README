##### Bootstrap 3 (Release) RTL version ######
This is an RTL **fork** of bootstrap.css that works well for RTL pages
This was created with a patch of R2 (https://github.com/ded/R2)
See my post of the subject at 
http://nirlevy.blogspot.co.il/2013/07/rtl-bootstrap-css-convertor.html

Note that you will need to set the 'direction: rtl;' on your body.

Also, the carousel does not work RTL so you need to set the carousel styles 
back to be LTR (see style.css)

Note that this is not thouroughly tested yet. Since this is a fork of  
the original bootstrap.css and bootstrap.js are included as well.
